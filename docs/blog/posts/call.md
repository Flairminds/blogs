Dear Atharva,

I hope this message finds you well. Following our recent call, I wanted to provide you with a concise summary of our discussion regarding the challenge you're facing in migrating your MySQL database to Aurora MySQL. The specific error you encountered is related to the version incompatibility between MySQL 8.0.33 and the current Aurora MySQL 3.x versions.

To address this issue, please note the following key points:

1. **Compatibility Issue:**
   - Aurora MySQL 3.x versions currently support migration from snapshots up to MySQL 8.0.28.
   - Migrating from MySQL 8.0.33 is not supported, and a logical migration is recommended.

   - Refer to the provided documentation for guidance on migrating data from an RDS for MySQL DB instance to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster.
   - Another resource outlines the process of migrating a MySQL Database to RDS for MySQL or Aurora MySQL.

4. **Workarounds:**

     a. **Backup and Restore using Native Tools:**
        - Utilize mysqldump for exporting MySQL dump.
     b. **Using AWS DMS:**
        - AWS DMS can synchronize data between RDS MySQL and Aurora MySQL with minimal downtime.

5. **Migration Types:**
   - Full Load, Full Load + CDC, and CDC Only mode options are available based on your specific use case.
